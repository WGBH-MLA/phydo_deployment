# Custom chef recipes

We don't have any yet, but OpsWorks requires a repository URL in order to
customize which pre-built recipes a layer uses.

Our (empty) repo for custom recipes is here: https://github.com/WGBH/aapb-cookbooks.
Any Chef recipes we wish to maintain should be done in this repository.

I believe OpsWorks requires that your custom recipe repo be public, which is why it's
in Github instead of here. If/when OpsWorks allows you to use a private repo,
it would make sense to move any custom recipes to this repo.
